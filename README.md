# coreutils-rust [![Build Status] (https://travis-ci.org/rgs1/coreutils-rust.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rgs1/coreutils-rust)

A rewrite of coreutils in Rust (for fun, not prod)

Note that there is a similar, much more advanced, project to rewrite coreutils here:

[https://github.com/uutils/coreutils] (https://github.com/uutils/coreutils)

I am doing this mostly to get a chance to explore Rust properly.
